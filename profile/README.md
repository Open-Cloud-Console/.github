# Open Cloud Console

Let's build the free-software building blocks for better cloud dashboard UI.

## Goals

- Develop bottom-up, useful UI/UX specifications to guide better cloud user interfaces.
- Create example code and importable free-software libraries based on these specifications.

## Repositories

- **specs**: This repository houses use cases, user stories, wireframes, and other product/design specifications essential for building our UI components.

## Discussions

- Since this organization is still in its early stages, much is yet to be planned. We invite you to start discussions [here](https://github.com/orgs/Open-Cloud-Console/discussions/categories/general) and help us build this together. Your insights and contributions are crucial to our collective success.

Letâ€™s collaborate to enhance cloud management through better interfaces!
